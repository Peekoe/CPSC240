Currently, the r.sh file will run the program in gdb mode, enter default inputs,
and enter the gdb commands described in the program document. If you'd like to
run it manually, I have commented out the ./ command for running the out file.

I did not add any validation for inputs so they must be floats and separated by spaces

There is also an input.txt file that I am using in order for those default inputs
to be entered, it is important to not alter it unless you only change the number
values.

You may still test my gdb commands manually but I tried to make it simple to run,
all you need to do is enter 'bash r.sh < commands.txt' and it will do the work
for you.

That's it, it works on my WSL Ubuntu 20.04. Thank you professor for a good semester
of one of the more interesting programming languages I've used. Have a great summer!
